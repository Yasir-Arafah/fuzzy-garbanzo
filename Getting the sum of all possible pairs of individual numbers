'''So basically the problem is to define a function which will return the sum of the all possible pairs of an given array of number list.
For example,the array is [5,6,6,7,7,7,5,3,4] and given the total number of the list.In this case the number is 9.
The solution of this problem is 3.Because there is a pair of 5,6 and 7(in this array,there are three 7 so there is a single possible  pair of number 7)
So the sum of the pairs is 1+1+1=3(Ans)'''
## SOLUTION ##
#First I am defining a Function named possible_sum_pairs which takes 2 parameters.One is the total number and another one is the array of a number list.
res=[]
def possible_sum_pairs(n, ar):                    # n is the representaion of the total number the given list , ar is the representation of the given array
    ar.sort()                                     # using the .sort() function it sorted the list in an ascending order like this [3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7]
    a=[i for i in ar if ar.count(i) > 1]          # using list comprehension method I have created a variable named a which will give me the all duplicate numbers like this [5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7]
    b=dict((j,a.count(j)) for j in a)             # then I created a new variable b which is a dictionary that gives me this {5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 3} , b tells me that I have 2 items of number 5,2 items of number 6,and 3 items of number 7           
    for k in b.values():                          # using a for loop in the values of the dictionary
        res.append(k // 2)                        # dividing the values in Floor Division by 2 and appending the answers in a gloval variable which is a empty list on line 7.The list will be like this [1, 1, 1]
    d=sum(res)                                    # using the sum() built-in function I have created a new varible d which stores the sum of my list.In this case d is 3
    return d                                      # finally returning d so that I can get my final ans 


There are so many ways to solve this particular problem.I have just shared mine.Happy coding!!!!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
